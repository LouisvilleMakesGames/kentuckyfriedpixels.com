This project is owned by [Louisville Makes Games](louisvillemakesgames.org) (LMG), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization designed to futher game development in the city of Louisville, Kentucky. This particular project is the website for our physical Game Jam, [Kentucky Fried Pixels(kentuckyfriedpixels.com). While it is meintained by the board of LMG, we accept community help and involvement inthe form of Github issues and pull requests to fix bugs and improve the site. Please note that the working of this Code of Conduct refers to the rules for our physical events in a physical space, we carry the same rules over to ous digital spaces such as our community open source projects.

All issues and requests will be subject to approval by the LMG board, and all contributors to [kentuckyfriedpixels.com](kentuckyfriedpixels.com) are expected to abide by this code of conduct.

By submitting a comment, issue, pull request, interacting with or becoming part of the team working on the [kentuckyfriedpixels.com](kentuckyfriedpixels.com), you agree to abide by this code of conduct, and cooperate with our facilitators who enforce it.

## Expected Behavior

We insist that everyone participates in this open source project remains mindful of, and takes responsibility for, their speech and behavior. This includes:

- Always acting out of respect and concern for the free expression of others.
- Actively listening to others and not dominating discussions.
- Respecting physical and emotional boundaries. Always ask before touching, and check in before discussing topics that may be triggering.
- Not making assumptions about identity, experiences, or preferred pronouns.
- Not using words that are racist, sexist, homophobic, classist, transphobic, cissexist or ableist.
- Humbly accepting respectful correction (or correcting yourself!), keeping in mind that the impact of your words on other people is more important than your intent.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We believe that failing to address dynamics of hierarchy, power and privilege alienates and further victimizes our members and prevents us from creating the safe equitable space we want.

**We do not tolerate oppressive behavior, harassment, destructive behavior, or exclusionary actions.**

**Oppressive behavior**: any conduct that demeans, marginalizes, rejects, threatens or harms anyone on the basis of identity, background, or ability.

**Harassment**: deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; disruption of events; aggressive, derogatory, or threatening comments; and unwanted physical contact or sexual attention.

**Destructive behavior**: damaging or altering any part of the building, inside or out, including furniture, equipment, or other people's belongings.

**Exclusionary actions**: denying certain participants opportunities to share views, skills and other contributions; engaging in favoritism; and creating or reinforcing an inequitable learning environment.

## Enforcement

Anyone‭ ‬asked‭ ‬to‭ ‬stop‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬is‭ ‬expected‭ ‬to‭ ‬comply‭ ‬immediately.

Anyone who engages in sustained ‬unacceptable behavior may be sanctioned ‬or‭ ‬permanent‭ly ‬expelled‭ ‬from‭ ‬the‭ ‬community‭ ‬without‭ ‬warning‭.
